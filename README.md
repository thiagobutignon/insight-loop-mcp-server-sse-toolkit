## Getting Started

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS recommended)
- Yarn (v1 or later)

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already).**
2.  **Install root dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd mcp-inspector-frontend
    yarn install
    cd ..
    ```

### üîë Environment Configuration

1.  **Server:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root. Fill in any necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys if your tools/CLI require them).
2.  **Frontend Inspector:** Create a `.env.local` file inside the `mcp-inspector-frontend/` directory. Add the URL of your running MCP server:
    ```plaintext
    # mcp-inspector-frontend/.env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
    ```
    Replace `http://localhost:3001` if your server runs on a different port or host.

### üöÄ Running the Project

1.  **Build the server and CLI:**
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
2.  **Run the MCP Server:**

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    _(Alternatively, use `yarn dev` if a development script with hot-reloading is configured)_

3.  **Run the Frontend Inspector:**

    ```bash
    cd mcp-inspector-frontend
    yarn dev
    ```

    The inspector will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Run the Tool Manager CLI:**
    ```bash
    yarn tool-manager
    ```
    This command executes `build/script/cli.js` using `node`. Follow the interactive prompts in your terminal to manage tools and prompts. The CLI provides options to:
    - Improve descriptions of existing tools
    - Create a new tool
    - Create a new prompt
    - List all prompts

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

- **üì° MCP Server**: Runs in the background (started via `yarn start` or `yarn dev`). It listens for incoming SSE connections on the configured port (default: 3001). Tools and prompts defined in the respective directories will be available to connected clients.
- **üíª Development CLI**: Execute `node build/script/cli.js` in your terminal. Choose options from the menu to create new tools/prompts or improve descriptions.
- **‚ú® MCP Inspector**: Access the frontend application in your web browser (default: `http://localhost:3000`). It will attempt to connect to the `NEXT_PUBLIC_MCP_SERVER_URL`. Once connected, use the sidebar to browse available tools and prompts. Select one to view its details and input parameters, then execute it using the provided form. The log panel shows connection status and interaction history.

## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary>1. What is the MCP SSE Server?</summary>

**Answer:** The MCP (Model Context Protocol) SSE Server is a real-time communication server that uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to deliver messages to connected clients. It adheres to the MCP standard, facilitating a structured and scalable communication protocol for AI-driven tools and prompts. This design enables efficient updates and interactions, making it ideal for projects that require dynamic, live data streaming and command execution.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. How does dynamic tool and prompt registration work?</summary>

**Answer:** Upon starting up or when a new client connection is established, the MCP server automatically scans dedicated directories (`./src/tools` and `./src/prompts`). It registers any new or updated TypeScript files found there. This dynamic discovery process ensures that any changes or additions to your tools and prompts are readily available to connected clients without needing to restart the server manually.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. What are Server-Sent Events (SSE) and why are they used?</summary>

**Answer:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) provide a mechanism for servers to push data to clients over a standard HTTP connection. Unlike WebSockets, which enable bi-directional communication, SSE focuses on one-way communication from server to client. This makes SSE particularly well-suited for live updates such as monitoring logs, showing dynamic tool execution status, or streaming notifications in real time.
