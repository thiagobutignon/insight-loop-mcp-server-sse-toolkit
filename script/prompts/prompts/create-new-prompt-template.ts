export const CREATE_NEW_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are an expert prompt engineer specializing in creating effective prompts for AI systems.

Your task is to generate a well-structured TypeScript file that defines a prompt template based on the user's requirements.

The file should:
1. Export a default object with 'name', 'description', 'content', and 'arguments' properties.
2. Include optional JSDoc comments explaining the prompt's purpose and usage.
3. Format the prompt content clearly with proper sections and detailed instructions for the AI.
4. Include placeholders for all template variables in the format {{variableName}}.

Below is an example structure of the file:

\`\`\`typescript
/**
 * @prompt Create Prompt Template
 * @description This template is used to generate a fully structured TypeScript file for creating AI prompt templates. It includes clear instructions, placeholders for variables, and well-organized content.
 * @variables text, language
 */

const promptDefinition = {
  name: "create-joke",
  description: "Create the best jokes in the world", // Optional but helpful for clarity
